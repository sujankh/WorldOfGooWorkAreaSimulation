This is a small program which moves the camera through a very big rectangular image which does not fit on the screen.

I was trying to simulate the behaviour of the game called World of Goo.

Language: C++ in which I have used more of a C oriented approach
Graphics Library: SDL (www.libsdl.org)

The executable has been placed inside the Executable folder which you can try.

Note that in order to use this code in an IDE, you need to create an SDL project and provide the linker settings.
